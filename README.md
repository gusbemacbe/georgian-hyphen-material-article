# Template with Materialize, Hyphenator and jQuery.nicescroll
I updated the new version of Hyphenator to turn Georgian available for the hyphenation.

One single HTML file of an article in the Google Material Design style with Hyphenator forked from [mnater/Hyphenator](https://github.com/mnater/Hyphenator) and with 3 different languages â€” English, French and Georgian.

### Test 1
It is one single HTML page, but it has still separated Javascript files (Hyphen). It has Materialize folders and Google Web Fonts links inside.

### Test 2
It is one unified single HTML page, which contains CSS codes and Javascript scripts. But it has still Materialize folders and Google Web Fonts links inside.

#### Observations:
